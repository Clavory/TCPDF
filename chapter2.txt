Chapter 2:Dashing Towards a Wall Without Looking Away

In the Sect, there was one rule: All High Heaven Pavilion Disciples were allowed to be challenged once every five days. If they had a level difference of three, the weaker Disciple was allowed to decline. The winner will then be able to gain contribution points, while the loser will have points deducted.

In High Heaven Pavilion, contribution points were equivalent to money. If you have enough contribution points, you could exchange them for anything you want, armor, weapons and etc from the Contribution Hall. Points can also be exchanged for money – dollars, but generally speaking these contributions were so hard to earn, that the disciples were generally reluctant to exchange it for that.

There were also many different ways to obtain these points. You can exchange them through the treasure hunt, completing tasks, etc.

The most common way to earn contribution points was to challenge others! The duels were to test their strength against other disciples, and if they won they earned contribution points.

So early in the morning, the many people crowded around Yang Kai were all staring a ripe persimmon about to fall.

Within the Sect, Yang Kai’s name was extremely renowned. Not only because he carried the identity of a Trial Disciple, but also because he still remained in the courtyard. Not to mention, famous record of eternal loses.

Yang Kai naturally remembered what it the commotion was, today was the fifth day from the last challenge. They who didn’t challenge him previously, could now. Who isn’t jealous? It was basically free contribution points! Although the points gained were not large, it was still enticing, thus many people still came.

In position, Yang Kai shouted out two words, “Please instruct!”

That being said, anyone knew that Yang Kai was in for another beating!

Yang Kai was always the first to attack. Even with his thin body he would always put out an amazing fight, taking the step to Zhou Ding Jun, then punched to the chest. Afterwards a simple and direct attack, then a tiger fist, his attacks were strong and it felt like all of his energy were in his attacks.

In the Sect, all disciples had to learn the Shaolin Fist. This fist was well-known, a basic move to keep disciples in shape and start them off.

Zhou Ding Jun didn’t panic, because he was stronger than his opponent by two levels. Sadly, this battle didn’t hold any suspense. Yang Kai’s fist was seen coming and easily dodged by that burly body.

Grazing past his clothes, Zhou Ding was unharmed. Punching again, Yang Kai was easily countered and hit in his solar plexus.

Suppressing the pain, Yang Kai quickly retreated and avoided Zhou Ding’s third strike.

“Eh?” This surprised Zhou Ding, he had would not have thought that his Third Stage Brother, could actually react fast enough. With this, his future plans were disrupted.

But this small error didn’t affect the situation. Thinking quickly, Zhou Ding took to the occasion to catch Yang Kai unaware.

Unaware, Yang Kai suddenly kicked his right foot forward. Seeing the shadow rapidly approaching, Zhou Ding saw his indomitable spirit, whilst executing a Shaolin fist.

[Crap!] His heart jumped. Although he had higher cultivation, he was inferior to Yang Kai in terms of battle experience.
But what would it matter? Even if he couldn’t dodge, he would take it head on.

Two light chuckles were heard, then Yang Kai fell backwards, while Zhou Ding was still standing. If his opponent was at the same cultivation as him, the he would have been the one to fall down.

Others couldn’t see the fists, but they clearly felt it. This disciple was too fast, so in other words he first hit himself then the opponent.

But, it was only his fist that was powerful. This body and health were all too frail, skinny arms, legs and body. Malnutrition was very obvious, thus resulting in this ending.

“Senior, thank you for letting me win!” This battle left quite a bitter result in Zhou Ding Jun’s heart. Although he won, he didn’t feel as if he had won.

To the side, many whispers could be heard: “This person thought he won?”

“Ha ha. Doesn’t that mean he didn’t know of Yang Kai’s reputation and challenged him? ”

“This is really too hilarious.”


Zhou Ding furrowed his brow, for he really didn’t know of Yang Kai’s reputation. He had heard people talking about him. So today when he saw many people crowding around, he had decided to participate too and was super lucky to be chosen.

[Why can’t I win?] His own fist made him go flying, thus making him at a supreme disadvantage. According to the gate rules, he had already lost.
“Again!” After this thought, Yang Kai stood up again without the slightest hesitation but with even more intense spirit.

Without waiting for answer, Yang Kai charged over. Three feet away, he swept his foot towards Zhou Ding’s legs in an attempt to topple him.

A leg whip! The Sect had Disciples cultivate various Martials Arts. Yet Yang Kai’s application of them far surpassed his peers, even though he knew fewer techniques.

So you could use a leg whip here.

Then without notice, Yang Kai went flying away again.

With two realms apart, also the gap between physical fitness, Yang Kai was once again defeated. His attack to Zhou Ding’s leg had clearly wounded his own bones, making him falter slightly.


“Again!” He said while clenching his teeth with eyes full of determination.

“Peng…….” Yang Kai flew away again.

“Again!”

“Peng…….” Yang Kai flew away again.


For those who couldn’t watch any longer had left, while the ones who stayed marvelled: “Yang Kai, this guy had real tenacity. No matter how many times he’s beaten down, he just gets back up. He won’t let it go!”
(Erza: ~Let it go~! Let it go~o! Sorry had to do that. 😛)

Hearing these words, Zhou Ding felt real bitter. He hadn’t imagined that his opponent was such a crazy person.

So Yang Kai was sent flying another seven or eight times. His face was swollen, eyes were black, staggering around and breathing quite heavily. But he still continued to persist and continue fighting.

Finally, Zhou Ding exclaimed: “Are you crazy? Throw down the towel or you’ll die!”
